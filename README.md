# Overview

This Password Manager program was created so I could learn more about Rust. I am expanding my knowledge of different coding languages.

This program in Rust helps protect and store passwords. It is a password manager. You have one master password for this program to access all your other passwords. In this program you can add new passwords and retrieve your old passwords.

# Development Environment

To develop this software I used Visual Studio Code, Rust extensions and google for different information about Rust.

The programming language I used was Rust. It is similar to C or C++ but has better memory capabilities. It was created by Mozilla in 2010 and has grown since then due to its unique features. Rust is really good for gaming development, embedded systems, security, web development and much more.

# Future Work

Things that could be updated or fixed in the future:

- In this program I could go in and add a feature to change the master password so it is more secure
- I could add a feature that will clear old passwords after use to prevent sensitive data from getting out
